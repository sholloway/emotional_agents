# Working notes for this simulations. 

## What are the hierarchy of Systems?
Perhaps there are multiple hierarchies of systems: 
- Physical Systems (Circulatory system, Digestive, Skeletal...)
- Mental Systems (Beliefs, Desires, Mood, Feeling)

## Feedback Loops
- Mental Systems Drive Behavior (i.e. Next Action)
- Physical Systems influence mental systems. 
  For example if the body suffers damage, then the agent may become afraid.
  If the body is hungry, the agent may feel irritable.

## What are the hierarchy of States?
